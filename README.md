*Heavy MACH: Defense* is a game where you need to create an army of machines in order to defend your castle from the enemy castle, in a top-down side-scroller style.

## Why? 

I was completely stunned when I recently learned that one of my favourite childhood game, 
[Heavy MACH: Defense](https://www.formidapps.com/ios/app.heavy-mach-defense-jBEDCiEx.aspx), had gone missing from the AppStore few years ago.

This decision was most likely taken because of an introduced [“bug” in recent iOS versions](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5371577) 
(newer than iOS 7) which made the game unplayable because of the impossibility to create a new save file.
The game seems to have unfortunately been abandonned by the company who developed it, [We Made Entertainment](https://wemade.com), leading to
no hope of a new upgrade to fix this.

Many people seem to miss this game as much as I do, and I would like to try recreating it from scratch for Desktop & Android environments 
(I will not be targetting iOS directly, even though minor modifications to the codebase should make it work there).

## Additional notes

- This repository holds a complete remake from scratch of the game.
  However, while the original studio has been notified about it, this may be effectively illegal.
  In such case, this repository will be either deleted or completely emptied.
- No money will be accepted from this work.
  This is all done on my free time and I do *not* want to earn money from this.
  This repository is (and will always be) free for everybody to use.
