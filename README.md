*Heavy MACH: Defense* is a game where you need to create an army of machines in order to defend your castle from the enemy castle, in a side-scroller style.

## Why? 

I was completely stunned when I recently learned that one of my favourite childhood game, 
[Heavy MACH: Defense](https://www.formidapps.com/ios/app.heavy-mach-defense-jBEDCiEx.aspx), had gone missing from the AppStore few years ago.

This decision was most likely taken because of an introduced [“bug” in recent iOS versions](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5371577) 
(newer than iOS 7) which made the game unplayable because of the impossibility to create a new save file.
The game seems to have unfortunately been abandonned by the company who developed it, [We Made Entertainment](https://wemade.com), leading to
no hope of a new upgrade to fix this.

Many people seem to miss this game as much as I do, and I would like to try recreating it from scratch for Desktop & Android environments 
(I will not be targetting iOS directly, even though minor modifications to the codebase should make it work there).
