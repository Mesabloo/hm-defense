## Assets redistribution policy

I have contacted the original studio to ask them if they wanted to give me the original assets (images, sounds, etc), but I
still have not received an answer to this day.
While I managed to gather all those assets from an official `.ipa` file installed on one of my apple devices, I will not be
redistributing them until I get an official grant for this (this README will be updated if it happens).

### How do I still play the game?

Because reverse-engineering an Android/Desktop app is pretty easy, leading to assets stealing, I will not put publicly available
releases on github, unless I encrypt those assets (the source code is public, so reversing this could also be very easy).

This folder will need to be populated with all the assets needed as described below.

Each entry is formatted as `filename.ext     # what this is`.<br>
The part `# what this is` is only a comment on what the file represents and should not be present in the filename. (TODO)
```bash
.
â””
```

Once done, a simple compilation using the `gradle` tool (as described in the root README) should work and generate either an
APK file or a Desktop executable.
